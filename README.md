# Prediction-with-Regression
discusses building simple linear regression models to predict delivery time using sorting time and to predict salary using years of experience. 
 It performs EDA, builds linear regression models, evaluates the models, and makes predictions for both tasks.
 For delivery time prediction, it imports data, visualizes distributions, renames columns, checks correlations, builds an OLS model, 
 evaluates coefficients and metrics, and makes manual and automatic predictions. 
 A similar process is followed for salary prediction using years of experience data.
